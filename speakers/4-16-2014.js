On the X axis, device detection determines the right quantity of code for the device; on the Y axis, resolution detection responds to the user\'s screen size; and on the Z axis, feature detection further tailors the experience to the browser\'s capabilities. With users located at points within this three-dimensional matrix, a single application can be served to everyone.'
