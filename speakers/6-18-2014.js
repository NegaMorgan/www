    desc: 'Node.js creates a unique opportunity for applications to share a common structure on both the front-end and back-end.  Amorphic is a new isomorphic framework still under development that blurs the lines between browser and server letting the author focus on what is most important â€“ the application itself.  In this talk we will get a preview of how Amorphic works by examining a simple application that uses it.'

    desc: 'D3 is a great library for data visualization, but when dealing with complex applications and DOM(SVG) manipulations are not fun. You can solve the problems with Ember. '

    desc: 'As web applications incorporate more high quality multimedia assets, developers need a consistent way of knowing when video or audio has sufficiently loaded for uninterrupted playback to deliver a great user experience. This talk illustrates the inconsistencies of browser implementations of the "canplaythrough" event and proposes an alternative solution of determining preload progress based on the element\'s "buffered" property.'
