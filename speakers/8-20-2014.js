First, we\'ll talk about making your code model real-world objects and problems; then we\'ll get down to brass tacks about applying DDD concepts in an actual web app, from defining a model to writing HTML5 UI interactions.'

    desc: 'I\'ll use some live examples to show how the HTTP 1.1 protocol works. I\'ll use telnet to show crafting HTTP requests by hand and use this as a basis for demystifying the HTTP protocol. We\'ll see the fine details of something you do (you do it implicitly, via your browser) probably thousands of times a day: request HTTP resources. If there\'s time I\'ll also use proxy tools to show how the coming HTTP 2 spec is going to be different from 1.1, and how it will change the way we build our HTML-based applications.  '
